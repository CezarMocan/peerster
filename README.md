Peerster - Lab project for the CPSC 426 - Building Decentralized Systems class, developed in C++ using the Qt framework.  
-- still in work --

Peerster is a network chat client, somehow similar to the well known IRC, which (for now) implements a gossip protocol for sending messages to all the peers in the network and also allows the possibility of sending private messages. 
In order to use it, you need to have qmake and make installed on your machine. 
Clone the repo, run "qmake" and then "make" in the peerster folder and then you can run the app.
