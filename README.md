<h3 align=center><b>Peerster - Lab project for CPSC 426 - Building Decentralized Systems</b></h3> 

<h4 align=center> developed in C++ using the Qt framework </h4>  

Peerster is a network chat client, which (for now) implements a similar (simplified) version of the well known Gnutella protocol. 
It is able to run in a completely decentralized environment, having the following functionalities: 
	- adding peers (by IP/host name + port)
	- NAT penetration, via a rendez-vous peer
	- group chat
	- private chat
	- file transfer (still sloppy)

In order to use it, you need to have qmake and make installed on your machine. 

Clone the repo, run "qmake" and then "make" in the peerster folder and then you can run the app.
